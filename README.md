# HTML Form Generator from JSON Schema

A React + TypeScript app that takes a JSON schema as input and dynamically renders a styled HTML form. Supports basic input types (`text`, `date`, `textarea`, `select`) and nested schemas through recursive rendering.

The main component handles schema input and parsing, while a separate `FormRenderer` component recursively generates form fields based on the schema structure.

Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, simple UI.
